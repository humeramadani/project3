      My approach towards this project from the very beginning was to do something with the use of scents, since I thought that it is a very different and unique approach to take to measure time.

Growing up in a household full of perfumes and fragrances, since my family owned business is that of perfumes, I have always linked different scents to different moments in my life. 

Using this idea I really wanted to create a physical prototype and not digital since we have been doing digital throughout the semester, and I wanted to make something very Interactive where the user can in a way enter my life with only the use of scents, and revisit my moments during that time period.

I wanted to create an autobiography for this project since I feel like it is a very unique idea for people entering and revisiting moments in my life by the use of scents only. I also wanted to create the concept of having no fixed timeline, where one can create their own timeline based on their interests, and memories they want to shape thier time around.

          <h3> INITIAL APPROACH  </h3>
          <br>

          <p>
            I wanted to create a step-by-step guide on how I'm going to go about with this project before I actually begin just to make it easier for me, and to also have and ideal plan and set up before beginning.


      

         
<br>
<br>
        Here is my ideal breakdown on how I was going to proceed with this proect.
<br>
<br>

        
      1-  Prepare the boxes <br>
      2-   Find cloth to place above the boxes<br>
      3-  Using Indesign, create a manual or sort of guide book that the user can go through before interacting with the boxes to understand each of the story behind it.<br>
      4-  If necessary, design a layout for the boxes, something other than black to add more meaning?<br>
      5-  If there is time, take an image of the boxes on someone's head.<br>
      6-  Create sample pieces for the scents<br>
      7-  Assemble the boxes, place the cloths, and place the guidebooks, create somewhat of an exhibition that one can physically interact with and experience MY life with the use of fragrances. <br>

              <br>

              To the left is a picture of a sample box I made, just to make sure the sizing and measurements are accurate enough for a headpiece. But to my surprise, my dimensions which were 16inch x 16inch were way too big and heavy for a head, so I thin brought it down to 14inch x 14inch, which worked out perfect.

<br>
<br>
        
          <h3> BOX LAYOUTS </h3>
          <br>

          <p>

         These are my final box layouts that I made which are the perfect sizing for an ideal head to fit in. To make sure of that, I made different students around campus try on my box and see if there is comfort in all of them, and that it could work as a universal headpiece, and it did!!!

<br>
        To the left are the boxes, while to the right is a picture of a student wearing my boxes to make sure of the sizing, which was a very important detail to me since I really wanted to succeed in an of the smaller elements as well.

          <h3> HEAT PRESS </h3>
          <br>

          <p>

            To add a more design element to my work, I wanted to include a generative art element to my boxes, to further enhance my idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore I used the idea of taking a picture of me from the time period, and abstracting it, to create a sort of dispersing effect, which better helped connect my idea of scents to time, and connecting that to myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            This was probably the most tedious parts of the entire project since I had to individually heat press a strip at a time, which was really really time consuming. This is why I only finished one of the boxes, due to time restrictions and limitations, but if I were to exhibit it, I would for sure complete all the boxes in a similar manner, while using a picture of myself from that time period and distorting it in a dispersing effect.

          <h3> SCENTS USED </h3>
          <br>

          <p>

           I will not be going in depth about the scents I used since that can be viewed on my  <a href="guidebook2.pdf" download>GUIDEBOOK</a> here. But on brief, these scents are from different moments in my life that make me feel nostalgic to those particular events, and are ways of me revisiting those moments in my life with the use of scent only.
            <br>
            <br>
            An additional detail is the use of black cloth inside my boxes for different purposes. One being so that it holds the scent longer, and the cloth will be left with the 'basenote', while also blocking vision as well as hearing to a limit, which leaves the user to only interact with the sense of smell, which forces them to only pay attention to that.
            <br>
            <br>
           To end this off, I would for sure link the scent of duct tape to this project, because of the amount of it I used throughout. So everytime I am going to smell duct tape, it will for sure remind me of this time in my life, which leaves this project being one of my memories that I will never forget...
