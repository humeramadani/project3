          Project 3 has been one of the most amazing and connected projects that really helped me explore myself as a designer and maker.
<br>
<br>
         With the use of physical as well as digital knowledge in design, I decided to create a physical prototype with a guidebook designed digitally and printed, in order to portray my autobiography with the use of Scents, which is an idea that can be applied to any user, who could use Scents to Measure Time.
          <br>
          <br>
         The reason why I am really satisfied with this project is because of its open-ended structure, which helped me do everything I have wanted to. With my love for scents and fragrances, love for creating physical models, as well as love for designing books, I put all of them together to come up with this prototype.

         There was constant sleepless nights, and days of working at university for hours!! But the outcome was worth it. I feel like reflecing back on this project, there are many positives that I can see, which include the minute details I took into consideration while creating the boxes, such as the circumference of the box, in order for heads of all sizes to fit in, the use of sample scents due to covid, the use of a generative art exterior for my boxes which helped disperse the idea of scent and myself into one object, and a lot more.

         Designing the book was a major challenge, since I had to try and create an effect of scents and typography in one, but managed to do well on that. I do feel like there are a lot of improvements I can make in this project, but with the time frame we were given, I think I did a good job in putting together a working prototype that could be exhibited and is ready for users to interact with and understand the concept of Measuring Time with Scent, by taking a glimpse into my life, and revisiting moments only wtih the use of scents...
